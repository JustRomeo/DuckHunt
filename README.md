# DuckHunt

## Description
Duo Duck Hunt is a shooting game. In this game, we have to shoot ducks that appear and cross the screen. When we touch a duck, it falls and we score points.

## Context
As part of our first year at Epitech, we had to carry out this project to discover the basics of the CSFML. This lib is an adaptation in C of the SFML lib used in CPP. This Project also aims to introduce us to the basics of the graphical environment.
